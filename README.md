# TUBES - Self-Assembly Edition


Tubes is a board game for kids aged roughly 8-12 which aims to show that the Internet is physical infrastructure, that data is copied into data centers and behaviour on the network is both observed and can have consequences.

The original game has many pieces but this self assembly edition shows you how to assemble the game with materials you probably have at home. It is a game for six players, if there are less players each may take more than one avatar.

**Game pieces**

Life cards
In the original game there are 3 life pieces per player. You can replace them by making LIFE cards/papers

6 x “BEE SECURE APP”
In the original game these are blue lego blocks. You can make cards/papers for them instead, or use 6 identical pieces from any other game

Data blocks & red/green counters
In the original game there are many red/green data blocks and counters. These can be replaced by cards/papers of the appropriate colour or with words good or bad. You can create these as you need them the first time you play the game

Avatars
In the original game these are lego mini figs on a baseboard. You can use any piece from another board game or make your own. They can also be cards/paper with the name of the player

1 x numbered dice

1 x coin
In the original game there is a red/green dice used to decide if a message is good or bad. It can be replaced by a tossing a coin: heads = good (green), tails = bad (red)

Other pieces
In the original game there are some other pieces, but they are not needed in this version. Instead of using a baseboard for the lost life pieces, they can be placed in a pile.
